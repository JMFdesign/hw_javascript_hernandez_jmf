## Resources

  * I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions

  * I, *Jessica Marie Francis Arnieri Hernandez*, reviewed the list of deductions for this project and the syllabus.

## Comments

  * After a couple of subsequent commits, I realized that I did not properly edit the commit with SHA# 0b9b8b4; it should have read "complete instructions under #5" rather than "complete instructions under #4".
